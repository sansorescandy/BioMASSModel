# BioMASS space model Repository

BioMASS introduces a highly efficient spatial model tailored for MAS that require dynamic neighborhood exploration and real-time locomotion across large spatial environments. The innovative aspect of BioMASS lies in its use of a quadruply linked list structure, which drastically reduces the computational complexity traditionally associated with agent-based model- ing platforms. This approach allows BioMASS to maintain constant-time performance for most of its core functions, including neighborhood search and agent movement, regardless of the environmentâ€™s size, the number of agents, or their perception range.

The spatial model is integrated into a simple yet versatile Java framework for multi-agent system simulation. Key classes within this framework include *Agent.java*, *Scheduler.java*, *Space.java* and *PhysicalObject.java*, which coordinate the core functions of agent behavior, simulation timing, and spatial environment management. The *PhysicalObject.java* class specifically equips agents with the four pointers necessary for insertion into the quadruply linked list. The orchestration of a complete simulation can be observed in the example code provided, where the *Main.java* class serves as the entry point. Running this class launches a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to configure key parameters for the provided example, such as the simulation space size, number of agents, and perception range.
